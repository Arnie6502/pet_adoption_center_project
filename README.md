Pet Adoption Center

In this project, I was tasked with debugging and enhancing the functionality of a Pet Adoption Center application. The application aims to:

Match Pets with Adopters: The program should match pets with potential adopters based on preferences like type, size, and age.

Calculate Adoption Fees: It should correctly calculate the adoption fee based on the pet’s age.

Add New Pets to the Adoption List: The application should allow the addition of new pets to the list, with warnings for duplicates.

Write Unit Tests: You will also write unit tests to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.

By the end of this project, I gained experience debugging code, working with dictionaries, lists, and conditionals, and writing test cases to validate the functionality
